# J-s-Dictionary

### Description
J's Dictionary is a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and uses a public API. Here is the link to the public API it uses ( https://dictionaryapi.dev/ ). This site allows users to look up the definitions of the words they desire to know about. Then the code returns the definition, phonetic, and the part of speech. 

### Features
- Look up the definition of a word.
- Get the definition, phonetic, and the part of speech.


### Installation
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account
2. Clone the repository to your local machine by clicking the green button on your screen written "CODE".
3. After you click "CODE" you can pick whichever link you want to use to clone the work to your local machine.

Once the work is on your machine you are free to do whatever you like with it. 

#### Happy coding :-)
